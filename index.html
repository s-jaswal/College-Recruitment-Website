            <h3><span class="orange">Studying At Princeton</span></h3>
            <p>We are a community of learning that is enriched by the wide range of experiences and perspectives of our
                students, faculty and staff. Undergraduate students benefit from the extraordinary resources of a
                world-class research institution dedicated to undergraduate teaching, while our graduate students engage
                in original and independent scholarship and research.

        </div>
        <div class="container">

            <p>Scholarship in the humanities forms and deepens us as individuals and as contributors to society. At a
                time when technology offers dazzling new possibilities and cultures collide in ways both exciting and
                dangerous, the arts and humanities provide crucial insight into what matters in life, into the character
                of civilization, and into the capacity — and the limits — of people’s ability to understand societies
                different from their own. </p>

            <p>The School of Engineering and Applied Science is unique in combining the strengths of a world-leading
                research institution with the qualities of an outstanding liberal arts college. In both its teaching and
                research, Princeton engineering pursues fundamental knowledge as well as multidisciplinary
                collaborations that make technology effective in solving complex societal problems. The school is
                committed to preparing all students — engineers as well as students from across the University — to
                become leaders in a technology-driven society.

                knowledge of human society and address some of the largest societal problems of the 21st century.

                        <p class="home-content_p">Our 5,200 undergraduate students benefit from living and studying at a
                            residential research institution, where faculty and staff devote much of their time and
                            energy to teaching, advising and supporting undergraduates. Princeton University’s 600-acre
                            campus is located in a cosmopolitan town (population 30,000) in central New Jersey, with
                            easy access by train to Philadelphia and New York City, each about 55 miles away.

                            Princeton guarantees students on-campus housing for all four years and 98% of students live
                            on campus. During their first two years, all students are required to live on campus in one
                            of seven residential colleges, which offers a variety of academic, social, cultural and
                            recreational programs, as well as academic advising. The colleges are designed to give
                            students a residential experience that takes the fullest possible advantage of the diversity
                            and educational opportunities at Princeton.

                            Juniors and seniors who wish to continue living in a residential college may do so, or they
                            may live in junior and senior dormitories; they have a number of dining options that include
                            eating clubs, cooperatives and independent dining. First- and second-year students typically
                            take meals in dining halls in the residential colleges.

                            With more than 500 student organizations, 38 sport clubs, 19 chaplaincies, and several
                            campus centers, the opportunities for students to engage in interests beyond their academic
                            studies abound. Sing with an a cappella group. Perform improv comedy. Join the debate
                            society. Write for the film festival. Try ultimate frisbee. </p>

                making a Princeton education affordable to all. Since 2001, grants have replaced student loans in the
                Princeton financial aid package for all aid recipients. The Princeton Financial Aid Application (PFAA)
                is free and easy to use for both U.S. and international applicants. Our generous financial aid program
                allows undergraduates to graduate from Princeton with little to no debt.

            <p class="col column-2"><strong>One of the Most Generous Programs in the Country
                </strong><br><br>Princeton’s financial aid program is recognized as one of the most generous in the
                country. Princeton is one of a handful of universities that applies the same financial aid policy to
                international students.

                We determine a family's ability to pay using our own simplified formula. Princeton’s no-loan policy
                replaces student loans with grant aid that students do not pay back.

                alumni
                of influence(Link is external) (Link opens in new window), ranging from Richard Stockton, Class of 1748
